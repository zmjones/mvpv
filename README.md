"Is There More Violence in the Middle?"  by [Zachary M. Jones](http://zmjones.com) and [Yonatan Lupu](http://yonatanlupu.com/).

> Is there more violence in the middle?  A series of studies over the last twenty years has suggested that violent outcomes such as civil war and human rights abuses are more common in regimes that are neither full autocracies nor full democracies.  Much of the literature takes this notion as a given, despite the fact that it has not been subjected to sufficient testing.  Existing work contains references to multiple types of violence, the outbreak of which is likely related to regime characteristics but also likely related to other types of violence.  In addition, existing work has not clearly specified what is meant by “the middle”, i.e., which regime characteristics are most predictive of violence.  This project aims to empirically describe which types of regime characteristics are predictive of which types of violence and to better understand the extent to which violence is more likely in regimes that are not on either end of the spectrum.  We use a random forest-like ensemble of multivariate regression and classification trees with a block bootstrap to jointly predict multiple forms of political violence using a large set of explanatory variables.  We compute the partial dependence for multiple measures of regime type to explore the possibly nonlinear and interactive relationship between political violence, many measures of regime type, and explanatory variables that are related to regime type and political violence.  Our methodology allows us to estimate the conditions (both in terms of regime type and type of violence) under which there is or is not more violence in the middle.
